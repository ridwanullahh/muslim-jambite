        content: `# Tech Skills for Muslim Students: Navigating the Digital Age with Islamic Ethics

In our increasingly digital world, technology skills have become essential for success in virtually every field. As Muslim students, we have the unique opportunity to approach technology learning through the lens of Islamic values and ethics, creating a foundation for responsible and beneficial use of technology.

## Islamic Perspective on Technology

Islam encourages the pursuit of beneficial knowledge and the use of tools that serve humanity. The Quran states: "And We made from them leaders guiding by Our command when they were patient and were certain of Our signs" (Quran 32:24). Technology, when used correctly, can be a powerful tool for spreading knowledge, connecting communities, and serving Allah's creation.

## Essential Tech Skills for Modern Muslim Students
